An endless runner where you are trying to navigate a rocket ship as far as possible.

Clicking the screen creates a black hole for the duration of the click.

The force of the black hole on the ship is the only way of controlling its trajectory.

Black holes do not affect any other objects. Maybe instead of a gravitational pull it’s a magnetic pull. Potentially an interesting obstacle at harder difficulties would be asteroids which were affected by the pull of the black holes.

Obstacles could be other ships, asteroids, aliens.

The rocket has a set speed, which can be altered by creating a black hole behind it or in front of it. Could have some obstacles which require changing the rocket’s speed to pass.

At each frame, the resultant force on the rocket will be calculated, and the rocket will point in the direction of that resultant force.

Could have different training levels to introduce certain obstacles. Normal asteroids, metal asteroids, aliens for example.

Have a single challenge mode which combines all the obstacles at once. Have the distance traveled as the score metric for high score tables.
